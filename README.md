* This plot illustrates that as latitude approaches the equator (latitude of 0 degrees), temerature increases. As latitudes increase into the northern hemisphere, specifically (denoted by a positive value of latitude), temperatures decrease. Especially as the northern hemisphere is currently experience winter, this makes logical sense. 


![lat_vs_humidity_chart.png](output_data/lat_vs_humidity_chart.png?raw=true "Title")
* This plot illustrates that there are a wide range of humidities at any given latitude. Other factors (such as latitude, cloudiness, or max temp) may be more beneficial in predicting humidity of a specific location. 

![lat_vs_cloud_chart.png](output_data/lat_vs_cloud_chart.png?raw=true "Title")
* This plot is similar to latitude vs. humidity, in that there is a wide range of cloudiness at any given latitude.

![lat_vs_wind_chart.png](output_data/lat_vs_wind_chart.png?raw=true "Title")
* This plot shows a wide range of wind speeds at any given latitude, but the majority of the wind speeds fall between 0 and 15 mph. Wind speeds above 15 mph are more rare, and these locations could be analyzed to be outliers or compared using other factors. 

# after each pair of plots, explaine what linear regression is modeling. for example, describe any relationships you notice and any other analysis you may have
